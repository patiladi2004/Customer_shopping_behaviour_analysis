Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

This project is an end-to-end data analytics solution designed to study customer purchasing patterns by examining 3,900 individual transactions. It uses Python for data cleaning and exploration, PostgreSQL for structured business analysis, and Power BI for creating an interactive visual dashboard. The primary objective of the project is to understand how different customers behave, what influences their purchases, and how companies can use this information to make stronger business decisions.

Project Description

The dataset used in this project contains 18 different attributes, including demographic details such as age, gender, and location, along with transaction-related information like product category, purchase amount, seasonal trends, shipping preferences, subscription status, and review ratings. This rich variety of data makes it possible to study how customers interact with products, how often they purchase, and which factors impact their purchasing decisions the most.

Python is used to prepare and clean the data. The preprocessing includes handling missing values, formatting the dataset, creating new useful features such as age groups and purchase frequency, and ensuring that the dataset is ready for further analysis. Once the data is cleaned, it is loaded into PostgreSQL, where detailed SQL queries are written to extract insights. These SQL queries reveal patterns related to revenue generation, high-spending customers, top-rated and most-purchased products, discount dependency, repeat buying behavior, and subscription trends. The insights also show how different shipping types affect order value and how various age groups contribute to overall sales.

To make the findings easy to understand, a Power BI dashboard is created. This dashboard visually presents customer demographics, spending trends, category-wise performance, revenue contributions, and customer segmentation. It helps viewers quickly identify patterns and understand how different customer groups behave.

Purpose of the Project

This project was created to gain practical experience in performing real-world data analysis that involves cleaning data, writing SQL queries, and building dashboards. It demonstrates how Python, SQL, and Power BI can be combined to extract meaningful business insights. The goal is to help organizations understand customers better so they can improve marketing strategies, optimize pricing, strengthen loyalty programs, and increase overall revenue.

Tools and Technologies Used

The project is built using Python as the main language for dataset preparation, PostgreSQL as the database for performing meaningful business queries, and Power BI for visualizing the results. Libraries such as pandas and numpy help process the data efficiently, while PostgreSQL queries help reveal spending behavior, discount patterns, product popularity, and demographic trends. Power BI converts the findings into clear charts and dashboards that communicate insights effectively.

Conclusion

Overall, this project demonstrates the complete journey of working with raw data and transforming it into valuable insights. It highlights the importance of data analytics in understanding customers and making informed business decisions. It also shows how combining multiple tools—Python, SQL, and Power BI—creates a powerful analytical workflow suitable for academic use, portfolio building, or industry applications.
